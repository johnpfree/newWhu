						<p>This site is the results of the obsessive documentation of my road trips for the last eight years.  I have kept a mileage log forever, since the 70's, but it wasn't the technology developments of the early 2000's, when I started travelling with my laptop and a digital camera, that I got the notion to put together an app to try to convey the experiences. </p>

							<li>Here is the <a target="_blank" href="http://cloudyhands.com/php/PicOrg/usmap.php">second try</a> from 2002.</li>
							<li>Here is the massive <a target="_blank" href="http://www.whufu.com/">third try</a>. It was at this URL until April 2017, when I moved it elsewhere and installed the new WUHFU.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>This website is the fourth try ... really the third try gutted and re-written to be more mobile-friendly and I hope, more people-friendly.</p>

									<dt>planning a trip:</dt>
									<dd>
										For short, familiar trips, I just "go". But for longer trips to unfamiliar places I rely on three tools:
										<ol>
											<li>Google Maps - mostly the directions feature which tells me miles and hours to get from one spot to another</li>
											<li>a spreadsheet - just three columns really - place, miles, hours</li>
											<li>My trusty <a href="http://www.allstays.com/Campgrounds/" title="Campgrounds for Camping">Allstays</a> camping app</li>
										</ol>
										I decide where I want to go, use the maps directions feature to determine what a 150 mile (2-3 hour) chunk of that trip is. On a well-run trip, that's how I want to roll - sleep late, take my time over coffee/breakfast, then do a little travelling from 1-ish to 5-ish, then stop early with enough time to enjoy whatever place I find myself in.<br />
										I use Allstays to find a plausible place to camp around there. If there is none, I adjust widen the search until I do find a plausible looking place. Enter into the spreadsheet where I started and where I think I'll end up and the miles and hours to get there.<br />
										Repeat, with that endpoint as the next day's starting point, for as many days into the future as I need.

									<dd>On a perfect travel day I have arrived at my campground mid-afternoon. I crack open a celebratory beer and crack open the laptop for a little whufuing - creating the content for this app. 
										<ul>
											<li>In the Spot Manager I add a new spot, or if I've been here before I add a new day to an existing spot.</li>
											<li>I enter a new row for today in the trip spreadsheet, including the spot id and the blog post id. see Nerd Notes below.</li>
											<li>Update the blog, with at least the shortcodes for this date and for this spot. How much actual writing depends on my time and inclination.</li>
											<li>Wrap all this up in time for a nice hour or two evening exploration of wherever I am, ideally with a nice sunset somewhere. If I have time I eat before, but usually I end up eating in the dark, since daylight is too valuable to spend "in the kitchen".</li>

									<dt>why do I do this?</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>Beavers are gonna build dams, programmers are gonna program.</p>
										<p>I was a professional computer programmer all my adult life. By the mid-2000's I still had the skills, still liked to do it, but  lost the ability so show up at a job interview and project caring about their stuff enough to get the job. I made the classic time-money tradeoff and chose time. This turns out to be what I do to feel fulfilled in retirement. Different strokes...</p>

									<dt>maps:</dt>
									<dd>I now use <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a> to render all the maps. 
										<ul>
											<li>The overnight spots are rendered from GPS information in the WHUFU database.</li>
											<li>The routes are drawn by hand using Mapbox or Google Maps depending on my mood at the time. Google has fixed an annoying feature in it's UI so it has regained its status as my preferred tool.</li>
											<li>I never got around to drawing a route map for some trips. For thse I simply connect the overnight spots with straight lines.</li>

									<dt>stories:</dt>
									<dd>I write my stories as <a href="https://wordpress.com/com-vs-org/">Wordpress</a> blog posts. I run a server and MYSQL on my laptop, so I can write posts at the campground without having to be connected to the internet. <br />
										This means I have to export them from my laptop Wordpress and import them to my server Wordpress, one of the least satisfying parts of this process, since any updates or corrections have to be done manually in both places.<br />
										I have a suite of Wordpress <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode">shortcodes</a> for grabbing pictures and Spot day descriptions from WHUFU and inserting them in posts. Also the day name headers in the posts are done by a shortcode which generates a "name" anchor tag so I may link directly to the part of the post for that day.<br />
										To display a story in WHUFU I crank up Wordpress to render the content into a <strong>div</strong>, so I get all those shortcode renderings exactly as in the actual blog..

									<dt>Internal techie stuff:</dt>
									<dd>
										<ul>
											<li>I use an ancient templating class called <strong>template.inc</strong>. Iâ€™ve built my own set of classes around it, mostly to encapsulate it's non-user-friendly looping conventions. It does pretty much everything I need.</li>
											<li>All the responsive behavior is from <strong>Bootstrap</strong>. It's pretty cool.</li>
											<li>Bootstrap has eliminated the need for much in the way of custom <strong>JQuery</strong>, but there's a little in here.</li>
											<li>The WHUFU code is a <a href="https://github.com/johnpfree/newWhu"><strong>github</strong> project</a>. Without the database, pictures, maps, and blog posts you can't really do much with it, but it's there.</li>
											<li>While travelling, I maintain a mileage log spreadsheet in Numbers (I'm a Mac guy). Along with odometer readings and place names and notes it has columns for the blog post id for that day and the id of the Spot where I stayed if any. Back home I export the spreadsheet as CSV, then run a little PHP program to read the CSV and create day records in the database. <br />
												This is the backbone of WHUFU, basically everything interconnects using the Trips table and the Days table.</li>
											<li>
												I have an extensive set of backend tools for entering all the data for WHUFU:
												<ul>
													<li>A Spot manager app for entering and editing Spots and the different times I have been to a spot (SpotDays).</li>
													<li>I upload pictures with iPhoto or the Canon app. I use Mac Preview for the initial winnowing. After I am down to just the pictures I want to show in WHUFU I run a little UNIX script based on the excellent <a href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/" title="ExifTool by Phil Harvey">exiftool</a> to resize them to fit in an 800px square and to cram a thumbnail into the EXIF data. The pictures for each trip go into a separate folder.</li>
													<li>When I have exactly the pictures I want in the folder for that trip I run the Picture entry app in that folder. It reads the image names creates database records for them</li>
													<li>Once they're in the database I run a Picture captioning app, to label each one and assign keywords.</li>
