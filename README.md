September 2016 - New WHUFU

The new responsive version of WHUFU. It's my vacation blog, but it's oh so much more.

The the version of this code is here:  http://whufu.com/. 

You can't really do much with this code without the database, picture library, map files, and blog posts, but here it is anyway.

# usage

It's kind useless without all these things:

* the database schema and the database, 
* the image library,
* the blog posts,
* the Google and Mapbox maps

Go to this page: http://www.whufu.com/?page=about&type=home and click on the Nerd section for some notes on these things.
